**Matchflix** is a movie-swiping app, similar to Tinder but for movies. It's built with React, allowing users to swipe through movies and add them to their list. Users can filter movies by genre, making it easy to find films that match their preferences. The app is designed to provide a fun and interactive way to discover new movies without the need for an account or login.
